Welcome to the documentation of the HH inference tools (https://gitlab.cern.ch/hh/tools/inference).

Read the [Introduction](introduction.md) for the setup instructions of this repository.
More detailed information on the different scans & fits you can run, can be found in the following sections:

- [Datacard Combination](tasks/combinedatacards.md)
- [Text to Workspace](tasks/t2w.md)
- [Upper limits on the cross section](tasks/limits.md)
- [1D Scans](tasks/1dnll.md)
- [2D Scans](tasks/2dnll.md)

Instructions on how to produce plots, with only datacards as a starting point can be found in the [Plotting Section](plotting.md).
Additionally there are also instructions to produce pulls and impacts plots [here](pullsandimpacts.md) and to validate your datacard [Datacard Validation](datacardvalidation.md), which wraps `ValidateDatacards.py` from CombineHarvester to perform some sanity checks.
